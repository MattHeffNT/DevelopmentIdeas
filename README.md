# Development Ideas
When I think of an idea, I note them here to come back to at a later time.

## Currently working on ##
- Streetfood MVP second iteration ready for cordova/react-native
- Strapi CMS with NextJS in Docker to create my own blog site to deploy to Azure
- Deploy Discord bot on Azure

## TO DO ##
- Fix some errors on skinpacker when buttons clicked numerous times
- Comprehensive digital safety Resource for domestic/violence victims (video + static page)
- Democracy app for Aus (similar to Finland concept)
- Look into whether OTTD has RTS Mod (LOL)
- List items not working properly in MS Planner extension

## Done ##
- Dictionary plugin for http://keypirinha.com (https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi or Meriam API)
- Need to update MS Planner Chrome extension as it has stopped working (i think probably the HTML elements have changed and the script just needs to update class/id names)
- Update the Custom Skin Compiler for Minecraft Education Edition (so that it can upload multiple skins)
- Update UI for VAFN - build out the ML for voice commands
- Super Super Sounds custom tumblr Theme
- Minecraft lessons
- Red Dirt Poetry Festival 2020 (online)
- nice geojson form/frontend where a user can add in their respective details (e.g. that get saved into the properties), click on respective location and it saves to a geojson file? https://github.com/MattHeffNT/GeoJSON-Form
- Create Chrome Extension to add Markdown to MS Planner https://github.com/MattHeffNT/markdown-msplanner (currently awaiting review in chrome store)
