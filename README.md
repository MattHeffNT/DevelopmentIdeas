# Development Ideas
When I think of an idea, I note them here to come back to at a later time.

## Currently working on ##
- Streetfood MVP second iteration ready for cordova
- Update Indigibot search filter, build frontend to add/remove search terms


## Backlog ##
- Comprehensive digital safety Resource for domestic/violence victims (video + static page)
- Mod for Rebel Galaxy Outlaws to add user's own Spotify. (when they release their source code)
- chrome extension to remove channels from Youtube that keep getting recommended to me
- interactive CDU Campus Map with search
