# Development Ideas
When I think of an idea, I note them here to come back to at a later time.

## Currently working on ##
- Minecraft lessons
- Red Dirt Poetry Festival 2020 (online)
- Super Super Sounds custom tumblr Theme
- Streetfood MVP second iteration ready for cordova
- Update Indigibot search filter, build frontend to add/remove search terms


## Backlog ##
- Comprehensive digital safety Resource for domestic/violence victims (video + static page)
- Dictionary plugin for http://keypirinha.com (https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi or Meriam API)
- Mod for Rebel Galaxy Outlaws to add user's own Spotify. (when they release their source code)
- interactive CDU Campus Map with search (get Lat/Long info for each of the different colours/buildings)
- automate Windows 10 mobile hotspot to switch on at startup

- nice geojson form/frontend where a user can add in their respective details (e.g. that get saved into the properties), click on respective location and it saves to a geojson file?
