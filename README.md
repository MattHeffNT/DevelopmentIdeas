# Development Ideas
When I think of an idea, I note them here to come back to at a later time.

- Mod for Rebel Galaxy Outlaws to add user's own Spotify. (when they release their source code)
- Front end form for Darwin City Council StreetFood JSON (with data validation)
- chrome extension to remove channels from Youtube that keep getting recommended to me
- Migrate StreetFood App to React and complete
- Update Indigibot search filter, build frontend to add/remove search terms
- interactive CDU Campus Map with search
